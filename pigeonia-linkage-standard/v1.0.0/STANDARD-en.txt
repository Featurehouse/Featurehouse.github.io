1. What's This

Pigeonia Linkakge Standard is a standard for making linkage in 1.16-or-above Fabric mods.
It makes making linkage in Fabric more convenient. We suggest all mods follow this
standard.

2. Context

To follow this standard, you should add a package into your main package in your mod
called `linkage` (e.g. com.example.mymod.linkage). In this package, you should add two
interfaces: `<ModShortName>Linkage` (e.g. MyModLinkage) and `<ModShortName>LinkageClient`
(e.g. MyModLinkageClient). Add @FunctionalInterface in both interfaces, `void init()` and
`void initClient()` respectively, and `@Environment(EnvType.CLIENT)` in the latter
interface. Add
`FabricLoader.getInstance().getEntrypoints("<mymod_id>", <ModShortName>Linkage.class).forEach(<ModShortName>Linkage::init);`
into method `onInitialize()` of your main class, and
`FabricLoader.getInstance().getEntrypoints("<mymod_id>.client", <ModShortName>LinkageClient.class).forEach(<ModShortName>LinkageClient::initClient);`
into method `onInitializeClient()` of your client class.

3. How to make linkage with other mod follows this standard

For the linkage context, write them in `<othermod_package>.linkage.<mymod_id>` (e.g.
net.another.othermod.linkage.mymodid). The main entrypoint class should be named as
`<OtherModShortName><MyModShortName>Linkage` (e.g. OtherModMyModLinkage), and be added
into entrypoint `<othermod_id>` in your `fabric.mod.json`. The client entrypoint class
should be named as `<OtherModShortName><MyModShortName>LinkageClient` (e.g.
OtherModMyModLinkageClient), and be added into entrypoint `<othermod_id>.client` in your
`fabric.mod.json`.

Do not use linkage classes in the main package, even in javadocs! That'll cause loading
linkage classes even the linkage mod isn't installed, and the result is CRASHES! However,
in the linkage clases, you can use the classes in the main package, because it is
necessary most of the time.

4. How to append this standard into your mod

You do not need to put this text file into your mod. Just add an object in `custom` in
`fabric.mod.json`:

	"custom": {
		"Pigeonia Linkage Standard": {
			"url": "https://featurehouse.github.io/pigeonia-linkage-standard/v1.0.0/STANDARD.txt",
			"version": "v1.0.0"
		}
	}
